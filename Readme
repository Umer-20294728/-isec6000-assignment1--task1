# ISEC6000 Secure DevOps Project - Task 1: Set Up Initial Infrastructure

In this task, we will set up the initial infrastructure for our Secure DevOps project. This includes creating a Kubernetes cluster on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), configuring `kubectl` to manage the cluster, and setting up a private GitHub repository to store project files.

## Step 1: Create a Kubernetes Cluster on GKE

1. Log in to your Google Cloud Console.

2. Navigate to the Kubernetes Engine section and click "Create Cluster."

3. Configure your cluster settings:
   - Cluster Name: [Umer-20294728]
   - Node Pool Configuration: Customize the node pool settings as needed.
   - Kubernetes Version: Choose the desired Kubernetes version.

4. Click "Create" to provision your GKE cluster.

## Step 2: Install and Configure `kubectl`

1. After creating the GKE cluster, configure your local environment to use `kubectl` to interact with the cluster.

2. In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the "Kubernetes Engine" > "Clusters" section.

3. Click the "Connect" button next to your cluster.

4. Follow the instructions to authenticate `kubectl` with your GKE cluster. Typically, you can use a command like the following (replace placeholders with your actual cluster information):

   ```bash
   gcloud container clusters get-credentials [Umer-20294728] -- --project [Umer-20294728D]


git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial setup for Task 1"
git remote add origin [https://github.com/Umer-20294728/-isec6000-assignment1--task1/]
git push -u origin master
